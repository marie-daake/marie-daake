        <h2>Rich in protein</h2>
        <p>Our products are based on a cricket flour with astonishing 70% protein. Rich in zink, magnesium, iron, calcium and B12, its simply a super food. Cricket flour is also a sustainable source of protein, as crickets are much more
            efficient to farm compared to traditional livestock.</p>
