        <h2>No beef intended</h2>
        <p>We want to challenge the attitude towards traditional protein and create insect based food that is
            irresistibly delicious.</p>

        <h2>Rich in protein</h2>
        <p>Our products are based on a cricket flour with astonishing 70% protein. This also adds a nice nutritional
            taste. Additionally, cricket flour is also a sustainable source of protein, as crickets are much more
            efficient to farm compared to traditional livestock.</p>

        <h2>About Eat’em</h2>
        <p>Our existing protein sources feed us but they don’t do a lot to preserve our planet. We wanted to change the
            scenery because we know we can have it both ways, a sustainable protein source that doesn’t take a huge bite
            out of our planet. Then we discovered the super power of the cricket and our mission is to make you eat:em.
