        <p>Humans eat a lot of food that has been sprayed with chemicals in order to protect it from insects. We can’t
            and
            we won’t give crickets food that have been sprayed with these chemicals because it would kill them. That
            means
            our crickets are cleaner than most vegetables on the market today. <br><br>
            But what does a cricket eat? Non-sprayed salad, a weird looking carrot and other organic greens. So fresh!
